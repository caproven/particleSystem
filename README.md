# particleSystem

A basic particle system using the CSFML bindings for the [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Requires SFML and CSFML to be installed.
For Ubuntu-based systems (I'm on Debian), these can be installed with the libsfml* and libcsfml* packages.

Scrolling on the mouse wheel will spawn in more particles.
Clicking the mouse or pressing a key will close the program.
